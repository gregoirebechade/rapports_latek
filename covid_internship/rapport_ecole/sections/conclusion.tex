\section*{Conclusion}


This study should be seen as a try to reproduce previous results on the consistency of autoregressive and ensemble models, but also as a first attempt to assess the robustness of some models with the evaluation on a huge set of diverse pandemics. 
The methodology for point classification is also a new way to compare model performnce, that might be useful during real outbreaks, as the reproduction number a popular quantity, which is often estimated. 
The results of the autoregressive and ensemble models are promising, as many aspects of previous research have been highlighted once again.
Future research on the consticency of models with error in the data might complete this one, by assessing that the observed robustness of the model is not only due to the quality of the data.
